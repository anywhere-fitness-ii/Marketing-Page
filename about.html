        It's important to me that you're happy. See there, told you that would be easy. Maybe we got a few little happy bushes here, just covered with snow. That's what makes life fun. That you can make these decisions. That you can create the world that you want.

            We spend so much of our life looking - but never seeing. All you have to learn here is how to have fun. Making all those little fluffies that live in the clouds. Just beat the devil out of it. All you need to paint is a few tools, a little instruction, and a vision in your mind. So often we avoid running water, and running water is a lot of fun.

            Think about a cloud. Just float around and be there. Now we can begin working on lots of happy little things. There's nothing wrong with having a tree as a friend. Use your imagination, let it go. We'll paint one happy little tree right here.

            The light is your friend. Preserve it. In painting, you have unlimited power. You have the ability to move mountains. Now then, let's play. Van Dyke Brown is a very nice brown, it's almost like a chocolate brown.

            We can fix anything. Only God can make a tree - but you can paint one. That's why I paint - because I can create the kind of world I want - and I can make this world as happy as I want it. Nothing wrong with washing your brush.

            Isn't that fantastic that you can create an almighty tree that fast? Just a little indication. Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it. I will take some magic white, and a little bit of Vandyke brown and a little touch of yellow.
