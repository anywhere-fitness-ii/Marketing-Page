    <p>
        It's important to me that you're happy. See there, told you that would be easy. Maybe we got a few little happy bushes here, just covered with snow. That's what makes life fun. That you can make these decisions. That you can create the world that you want.

            We can fix anything. Only God can make a tree - but you can paint one. That's why I paint - because I can create the kind of world I want - and I can make this world as happy as I want it. Nothing wrong with washing your brush.

            Isn't that fantastic that you can create an almighty tree that fast? Just a little indication. Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it. I will take some magic white, and a little bit of Vandyke brown and a little touch of yellow.
