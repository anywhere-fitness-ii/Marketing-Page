      If you don't think every day is a good day - try missing a few. You'll see. A fan brush is a fantastic piece of equipment. Use it. Make friends with it.

      As trees get older they lose their chlorophyll. It's almost like something out of a fairytale book. Work that paint.

      Let's do that again. Pretend you're water. Just floating without any effort. Having a good day.

    <p>Let's do that again. Just let these leaves jump off the brush You need to have a very firm paint to do this. Nature is so fantastic, enjoy it. Let it make you happy.</p>

    <p>There comes a nice little fluffer. So often we avoid running water, and running water is a lot of fun. I like to beat the brush.

    We don't need any guidelines or formats. All we need to do is just let it flow right out of us. Don't kill all your dark areas - you need them to show the light. Even trees need a friend. We all need friends. Nothing's gonna make your husband or wife madder than coming home and having a snow-covered dinner. You can't make a mistake. Anything that happens you can learn to use - and make something beautiful out of it.
